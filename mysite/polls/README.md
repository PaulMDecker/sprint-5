# Overview

The web app I wrote is a polling app for a variaty of questions. you start the server by using terminal to acess the directory where the mysite directory is stored. then enter 'python3 manage.py runserver' into the terminal to start the server. the address is 'http://localhost:8000/polls/'


I wrote this software to help familiarize myself with programming using django.

# Web Pages


There are three web pages for this app. 
The first web page has a list of all the questions being polled and links to those questions. 
    You navigate to the second page by clicking on one of the questions to answer. 
the second page has the question, several possible answers to choose from, and a vote button when you have chosen.
    You navigate to the last page by clicking on the vote button.  
The third page has a tally of how many votes each answer has as well as a button that leads to the second page for that same question. I can't get the button to lead anywhere else without getting a error.

# Development Environment

I wrote the program using Visual Studio Code 

I used python, html, and css to write this program.
# Useful Websites

* [django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
* [google](https://www.google.com/?client=safari)

# Future Work

* have it cycle through the questions and return to the start page.
* give backgrounds to all the pages
